# Setting Up Your Environment

Before you can run this project, you need to set up your environment. Here are the steps you should follow:

## 1. Install Python

You'll need to install Python on your machine. You can download Python from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

## 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's best practice to create a virtual environment for your project. This will help ensure that your dependencies are isolated from other Python projects on your machine.

To create a virtual environment, open a terminal window and run the following command:

python3 -m venv env


This will create a new virtual environment in a directory named `env`.

## 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

To activate the virtual environment, run the following command in your terminal:

source env/bin/activate


This will activate the virtual environment and you should see `(env)` appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

## 4. Install the Dependencies

The project dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt


This will install all the necessary packages and dependencies required to run the project.
